    "overallimpression": "A refreshing drink with the character of fresh apples, though not necessarily exhibiting strong varietal character. The apple character must be present but may be subtle. These ciders are generally lower in tannin and higher in acidity. Balance and drinkability are the critical success factors.",
    "aroma": "Sweet apple aroma; may have subtle apple varietal character. Low levels of DMS are acceptable but not required. Commercial examples may have very subtle sulfur note, though this is not a requirement. No significant esters unless from fruit additions. Clean fermentation profile is strongly preferred.",
    "appearance": "Clear to brilliant. Color should be that of apple juice, ranging from straw to medium gold. May have very pale greenish tint from certain apple varietals. Usually still, though light effervescence is acceptable.",

    "aroma": "Pronounced apple aroma with distinctive varietal character. Different apple varieties exhibit a range from bright and fruity to rich and complex. DMS is generally inappropriate. Esters may be present but should be subtle and not compete with apple character. Clean fermentation profile.",

If a variety of apple is declared, the specific apple varietal character should be noticeable. The added fruit should lend an attractive and distinctive character, but not be harsh or unnatural.",

    "aroma": "There should be a subtle to moderate perry character, but not necessarily recognizable as any single variety of pear. Generally dry perry will not have as intense of an aroma as sweet perry. Some slight alcohol aroma may be present. If made with eating pears, a subtle Bartlett pear character is acceptable.

Moderate acidity, medium to medium-low tannins, depending on pears used and processing techniques. Generally dry perry will not be as sweet as sweet perry, obviously.
