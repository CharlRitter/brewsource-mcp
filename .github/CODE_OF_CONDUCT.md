# BrewSource MCP Server Code of Conduct üç∫

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community centered around our shared passion for brewing and technology.

## Our Standards

- **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

#### Brewing Community Values
- **Sharing knowledge freely** - The brewing community thrives on shared knowledge and experimentation

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

#### General Harassment
- **Violent threats or language** directed against another person

- **Gate-keeping behavior** - making others feel unwelcome based on their skill level

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

- **Events and conferences** - When representing the project at brewing or tech events
- **Social media** - When posting with official project accounts or explicitly representing the project
- **External forums** - When discussing the project in other online communities

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

5. **Any additional context** that might be helpful

### Confidentiality

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. We may involve additional team members or external experts when necessary to properly address the situation.
