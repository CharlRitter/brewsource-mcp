# BrewSource MCP Server üç∫

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for brewing resources, built with Go.

## What is This?

**BrewSource MCP** is a specialized MCP server that gives AI assistants access to essential brewing knowledge and tools.
 Currently in **Phase 1 MVP**, it focuses on core public resources:

- **Beer & Brewery Discovery** - Search basic commercial beer and brewery databases
- **BJCP Style Guide** - Complete beer style database with lookup capabilities
- **Public API Layer** - Three core MCP tools for essential brewing queries

Future phases will expand with ingredient databases, personal analytics, recipe builders, and premium Brewfather integration.

## Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**MCP is a standardized way for AI assistants to access external tools and data.** Instead of being limited to their training
 data, AI models can:

- **Call external APIs** (like Brewfather, BJCP data)
- **Access databases** (brewery catalogs, ingredient databases)
- **Perform calculations** (brewing formulas, recipe scaling)
- **Retrieve real-time data** (current beer availability, events)

**Our MCP server** exposes **resources** (data) and **tools** (functions) that AI assistants can use to provide expert
 brewing assistance.

### MCP Resources (Data Access) - Phase 1 MVP

- `bjcp://styles` - Complete BJCP style guide (basic lookup)
- `breweries://directory` - Basic brewery database (name, location)
- `beers://catalog` - Basic commercial beer database (name, style, brewery)

*Note: Enhanced resources and ingredient databases will be added in future phases.*

### MCP Tools (Functions) - Phase 1 MVP

- `bjcp_lookup` - Get detailed BJCP style information by code
- `search_beers` - Search commercial beer catalog by name, style, brewery
- `find_breweries` - Find breweries by location or name

*Note: Additional tools will be released in future phases as outlined in the roadmap below.*

## Hybrid Data Storage Approach

BrewSource MCP uses a hybrid data storage strategy:

- **BJCP styles and reference data** are stored as version-controlled JSON files in `app/data/`.
- **Application data** (beers, breweries, users, etc.) is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Development Guide

### Adding New Tools

1. **Define the tool function** in `app/internal/handlers/tools.go`:

```go
func (h *ToolHandlers) MyNewTool(ctx context.Context, args map[string]interface{}) (*mcp.ToolResult, error) {
    // Your tool implementation
    return &mcp.ToolResult{
        Content: []mcp.ToolContent{{
            Type: "text",
            Text: "Tool result",
        }},
    }, nil
}
```

1. **Register the tool** in `RegisterToolHandlers()`:

```go
server.RegisterToolHandler("my_new_tool", h.MyNewTool)
```

1. **Add tool definition** in `getToolDefinition()` method in `app/internal/mcp/server.go`

### Adding New Resources

1. **Create resource handler** in `app/internal/handlers/resources.go`:

```go
func (h *ResourceHandlers) HandleMyResource(ctx context.Context, uri string) (*mcp.ResourceContent, error) {
    // Your resource implementation
    return &mcp.ResourceContent{
        URI:      uri,
        MimeType: "application/json",
        Text:     "resource data",
    }, nil
}
```

1. **Register the resource** in `RegisterResourceHandlers()`:

```go
server.RegisterResourceHandler("my://resource/*", h.HandleMyResource)
```

### BJCP Style Guide

The `app/pkg/data` package manages beer style data:

```go
// Load and search styles
styleGuide := bjcp.NewStyleGuide()
styleGuide.LoadFromJSON(bjcpData)

// Get specific style
style, err := styleGuide.GetStyle("21A") // American IPA

// Search styles
results := styleGuide.SearchStyles(bjcp.StyleSearchQuery{
    ABVMin: 5.0,
    ABVMax: 7.0,
    IBUMin: 40,
})
```

## Phase 1 Implementation Status

**BrewSource MCP** is currently in Phase 1 MVP with the following implemented features:

### Core MCP Tools

- **`bjcp_lookup`** - Look up BJCP beer styles by code (e.g., "21A") or name
- **`search_beers`** - Search commercial beers by name, style, brewery, or location
- **`find_breweries`** - Find breweries by name, location, city, state, or country

### MCP Resources

- **`bjcp://styles`** - Complete BJCP style guidelines database
- **`bjcp://styles/{code}`** - Individual style details (e.g., bjcp://styles/21A)
- **`bjcp://categories`** - List of all BJCP categories
- **`beers://catalog`** - Commercial beer database
- **`breweries://directory`** - Brewery directory

### Infrastructure

- **PostgreSQL Database** - Persistent storage with proper indexing
- **Redis Caching** - Optional caching layer for improved performance
- **Seed Data** - Pre-populated with BJCP styles, breweries, and commercial beers
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests for brewing calculations and BJCP utilities

### Developer Experience

- **Makefile** - Common development tasks (`make help` to see all commands)
- **Environment Configuration** - Managed via .envrc and direnv
- **API Documentation** - Clear tool and resource schemas
- **Code Quality** - Proper error handling, logging, and Go best practices

## Architecture Deep Dive

### MCP Protocol Flow

1. **Client Connection**: MCP client connects via HTTP
2. **Initialization**: Client and server exchange capabilities
3. **Resource/Tool Discovery**: Client can list available resources and tools
4. **Request/Response**: Client calls tools or requests resources
5. **JSON-RPC 2.0**: All communication uses JSON-RPC 2.0 format

### Database Design

The database schema supports:

- **Breweries** with location and contact information
- **Beers** linked to breweries with style classifications
- **BJCP Styles** with complete style guidelines
- **Ingredients** with type-specific properties (JSON fields)
- **Recipes** with ingredient lists and calculations

### Caching Strategy

- Redis caches frequently accessed data (BJCP styles, ingredient lookups)
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexes
- Static data (style guide) is loaded once at startup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors**

```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
pg_isready

# Verify database exists
psql -l | grep brewsource

# Test connection string
psql "your-database-url-here"
```

**Port Already in Use**

```bash
# Check what's using port 8080
lsof -i :8080

# Run on different port
./bin/brewsource-mcp -port=8081
```

**Missing Environment Variables**

```bash
# Check your environment variables (set via .envrc)
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

**Build Errors**

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
make clean
make build
```
